				<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
				<h2>What is Glassboard?</h2>

<p>Glassboard is a private social network for businesses. It&rsquo;s like Facebook, but with the privacy of email and the immediacy of mobile. In Glassboard, you create &lsquo;boards&rsquo; which are groups of people around a common interest, and you can share messages, comments, photos, videos, files and even your location (when appropriate).</p>

<p>Jump to <a href="/support/faqs.html#premium">Glassboard premium FAQs</a></p>

<p>Glassboard <a href="/privacy/">privacy policy</a> and <a href="/tos/">terms of service</a>.

<p><a href="/support/faqs.html#where_download">Where can I download the app?</a></p>


<h2>Who can see the content I share?</h2>

<p>Think of each board as a different group of people. If you have a board that shares dog pictures, and a board that talks about classic cars, neither group will ever know about the other. Your dog pics will be seen only by the people in the dog pics board, and talk about classic cars will only be shared with the members of the classic cars board.</p>

<h3>I just got an 'invitation code', now what?</h3>

<p>Invitation codes are used to send out in email or twitter to get people into boards quickly. All you need to do is open your Glassboard app (or log into Glassboard.com) and you'll see a link to "enter invitation code". Tap that and enter the invitation code you received, and you'll join the board.  </p>

<p><br>

<h3>I just got an email invitation, now what?</h3>

<p>If you know the person who sent the invite and want to accept the invitation, just click Join in the email and you&rsquo;ll be taken to a page where you can either log in or create an account. If you&rsquo;re new, you can track the conversation through the web, through one of our mobile phone clients, or both.</p>

<p><br>

<h3>How do I create an account?</h3>

<h4>On the web</h4>
<a href="https://app.glassboard.com/web/Register" target="_new">Click here to create an account</a> in Glassboard.
<p>

<h4>On the phone</h4>
Just tap the Create Account button on the login screen, and give us your details (we will not share it with anyone) and you&rsquo;ll be good to go. Later we&rsquo;ll send you an email to verify the account &mdash; we ask that you do so within 24 hours (all you need to do is click a link in an email we send you). </p>

<p><br>
<h3>Someone told me they invited me, where do I get my invitation?</h3>

<h4>On the web:</h4>
<p> <a href="http://app.glassboard.com" target="_new">Click here to open the web app</a>. When you&rsquo;re in the web app, just click on the notification icon up top, then click on the invitation notification. A dialog box will appear. You can accept the invitation there.
<p>
<iframe id="faqs" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/42153069" width="400" height="250" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

<h4>On the phone:</h4>

<p>In this case, all you need to do is look in your Notifications tab, and you&rsquo;ll find the invite in there. See this example. </p>
<p></p>
<iframe id="faqs" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/27993159?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>

<h4>In Email:</h4>

<p>The subject lines for these emails reads: <br/>
<b>John Doe has invited you to &ldquo;Board Name&rdquo; on Glassboard!</b></p>
<p>All you&rsquo;ll need to do is click on the Join link in the email. After that, if you have an account in the system, the system will ask you for a password, if not, the system will ask you to create an account. </p>

<iframe id="faqs" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/27987020?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>

<p><br>
<h3>Not seeing the invite?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb here and assume the board chair doesn&rsquo;t have your current email address. I would go back to the board chair and ask them to re-invite you with the correct address.</p>

<p><br>
<h2>Boards</h2>

<h3>How do I create a board?</h3>

<h4>On the Web</h4>
<p>On the left hand side of the screen you will see a link below the board list that says Create a Board. Click this link and a dialog will pop up asking for a board photo and a board name. </p>

<h4>On the Phone</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open the sidebar
<li>Tap Create a Board (below the board list)
<li>Tap the camera to chose a picture (optional) and provide a name
<li>Tap Create Board
</ul>
<p><br>
Remember that you get three boards as a new person in Glassboard. To get more boards, you need to invite new people into Glassboard. Once they accept your invitation and create an account, you&lsquo;ll get a free board.
<p>

<h3>How do I share a video with a board?</h3></a>

<p>See <a href="#share_photo">How do I share a photo with a board</a>.... and swap photo for video and you&rsquo;ll get the gist. </p>
<p><em>Important: videos can take a long time to upload. Please be patient, or wait to upload when you&rsquo;re on wifi. Either way, you may need to experiment with the length of the video and where you upload it. Also, both the video and the thumbnail may not be available immediately after you upload a video. Each video needs to be processed for playback on different devices.  </em></p>

<p><br>
<h3>How do I share my location?</h3>

<p>See <a href="#sharing_message">Sharing a message</a>. While in the new message window, you&rsquo;ll see a selector on the left side labeled Add Location. When highlighted, location is on. When location is on it will be attached to the message.</p>
<p>Remember that your location is sent to everyone on the board, but it only represents where you were when the message was sent. </p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

				<h3>Board </h3>

				<p>A group of people within Glassboard. Your boards can be made up of colleagues, friends, or family. It&rsquo;s all up to you. Boards are private from one another within the app: if you share photos on your family members board, only they will be able to see them.</p>
				<h3>Board members</h3>

				<p>People on your board.</p>

				<h3>Board chair</h3>

				<p>The person who creates a board is the board chair. They can invite and remove members, change the board picture, and delete the board. After a board is deleted it is gone completely: all of the photos, videos, messages, and comments are deleted from our system.</p>
				<h3>News Feed</h3>

				<p>The News Feed displays a collection of all the most recent activity from all of the boards that you belong to.</p>
				<h3>Notifications and Quiet Hours</h3>



				<p>The notifications tab displays actions taken by others on things that you&rsquo;ve posted, such as someone liking or commenting on a photo of your cat.</p>
				<p>This feature lets you specifiy a time period where the app will not send you any push or email notifications. So you can get some uninterrupted zzzs. </p>
