<h2 id="5.proprietaryrightslicensesandlimitations">5. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, LICENSES AND LIMITATIONS</h2>

<p>Second Gear Rights </p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that Second Gear (and any licensors to Second Gear) own(s) all legal right, title and interest in and to the Service, including, without limitation, all software comprising a part of the Service that is either hosted on Second Gear&#8217;s servers enable sharing of Content originating at another party&#8217;s web site, and all intellectual property rights therein (whether registered or not and wherever existing in the world). You further acknowledge and agree that the rights in the Service, including all intellectual property rights, are protected by one or more of copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, regulations and treaties, in addition to these Terms of Service and any Separate Agreement. Except for the limited license rights specifically granted to you in these Terms of Service (and any rights expressly granted to you in a Separate Agreement), Second Gear and its suppliers own and shall retain all rights, title and interests, including, without limitation, intellectual property rights, in and to the Service and all Software utilized therein (and all copies thereof and related materials that are delivered or made available to you with the Service). </p>

<p>In order to enable Second Gear to operate the Service, we must obtain from you certain license and other rights to the Content you submit (so that our processing, maintenance, storage, technical reproduction, back-up and distribution, and related handling of your Content doesn&#8217;t infringe applicable copyright and other laws). Accordingly, by using the Service and posting Content, you grant Second Gear a license to display, perform and distribute your Content, and to modify (for technical purposes) and reproduce such Content to enable Second Gear to operate the Service. (You also agree that Second Gear has the right to elect not to accept, post, store, display, publish or transmit any Content in our sole discretion.) You agree that these rights and licenses are royalty free, irrevocable and worldwide, and include a right for Second Gear to make such Content available to, and pass these rights along to, others with whom Second Gear has contractual relationships related to the provision of the Second Gear Service, solely for the purpose of providing such services, and to otherwise permit access to your Content to third parties if Second Gear determines such access is necessary to comply with its legal obligations. </p>

<p>Except for the limited license and other rights granted in these Terms of Service, you retain all of the rights you had in your Content before you submitted it; unless you elect to enable others to view or have access to the Content you submit to the Service, no one else should see your Content without your consent. Of course, if you do elect to publish and share any portion of your Content by placing it into one or more boards, then, in doing so, you are enabling each of those permitted users of the Glassboard Service access to use, display, perform, distribute and modify your Content (subject to any understandings or agreements you and such users may work out without Second Gear&#8217;s involvement). </p>

<p>Your Rights </p>

<p>As indicated above, you retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Service. Other than the limited license and other rights you grant in these Terms of Service, Second Gear acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms of Service in or to any Content that you submit, post, store, transmit or display on, or through, the Service, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You agree that you are solely responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Second Gear has no obligation to do so on your behalf. </p>

<p>Second Gear hereby grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the Software provided to you by Second Gear as part of the Service as provided to you by Second Gear, for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as permitted by these Terms of Service, until your rights are terminated in accordance with these Terms of Service. </p>

<p>(a) These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Second Gear and governs your use of the Service, except, and then only to the extent that you have entered into a Separate Agreement. These Terms of Service, as in effect from time to time, supersedes any prior agreements or earlier versions of these Terms of Service between you and Second Gear for the use of the Service. If, through accessing or using the Service, you utilize or obtain any product or service from a third party, you may additionally be subject to such third party&#8217;s terms and conditions applicable thereto, and these Terms of Service shall not affect your legal relationship with such third party. </p>

<p>(b) You acknowledge and agree that each affiliate of Second Gear shall be a third party beneficiary to these Terms of Service and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of these Terms of Service which confers a benefit on (or provides rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be a third party beneficiary to these Terms of Service. </p>

<p>(c) These Terms of Service and the relationship between you and Second Gear shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

<p>(d) The failure or delay by Second Gear to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service or rights under applicable law shall not constitute a waiver of any such provisions or rights. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&#8217; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. </p>

<p>(e) You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of or related to use of the Service or otherwise under these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or you hereby agree to be forever barred from bringing such claim. </p>
