<h1>Glassboard invitation codes</h1>

<h2>What are invitation codes?</h2>
<p>Invitation codes for Glassboard are short strings of characters that you can use to join a board. The chairperson (the person who created the board) can generate and give out invitation codes at their discretion. People can then input the code into the Glassboard app to join a board, and finally the chairperson can either approve or deny incoming requests.</p>

<h2>How do I invite people to my boards using invitation codes?</h2>
<p>If you created a board, you are the only person who can invite people to it. When you're in a board and you select to invite people, you will see a button to create an invitation code. Once you generate an invitation code, you can then send it to people you'd like to have on your board. You can email, text, or just tell it to someone.</p>

<p>If someone uses your invitation code, you will then need to approve them as a final step to get them onto your board. To approve someone, navigate to the Members list of your board, and you will see a list of Join Requests (via code). For an individual you can first view their name and email address, and then opt to Accept Join Request to grant them access to your board. Keep in mind that as chairperson you can always remove people later.</p>

<h2>What do I do if I receive an invitation code?</h2>
<p>In Glassboard when you are viewing your board list, you will see "Enter Invitation Code..." at the bottom.

From here you enter the code you were given to request access to a board. The board chair will then need to approve your request. You will receive a notification once you are allowed access to the board.</p>
