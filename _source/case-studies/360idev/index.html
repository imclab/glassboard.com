title: Case Study - 360iDev
caption: 360|iDev does events because they love the community of developers around iOS and wanted to provide a way to get more technical information (from their peers) that what is typically available via the normal channels directly from the mothership.

      <h4>How are you using Glassboard?</h4>
      <p>We use Glassboard for every conference we organize, often creating two boards, a speakers only board that allows speakers and myself to coordinate things, plan, and in general chat. The other board is the overall conference board that every attendee is encouraged to join. Glassboard has become the official unofficial back channel for the conference. Whether it’s attendees planning a night out or which session to hit next, it’s a great way for everyone to be able to communicate.</p>

      <h4>Why Glassboard? </h4>
      <p>We started using Glassboard because it was created by friends of the conference, but likely would have started using it once we heard about it anyway. Twitter is great, but is not private, we like that glass board boards are private so attendees can talk about sessions and speakers talk about things that aren’t relevant to attendees.</p>
      <h4>If not Glassboard what would you use? </h4>
      <p>Honestly I don’t know. probably something more broadcast. Our official conference app allows us to push updates to attendees, that plus twitter would likely have to fill the gap.</p>
