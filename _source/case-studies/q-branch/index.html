      <h4>How are you using Glassboard?</h4>
      <p>We use Glassboard for day-to-day communication between the three of us. John and I use iMessage for rapid design discussion, but for anything over the threshold of nerding out over font weights or nit-picking comps, we turn to Glassboard. And not just product discussion; we cover everything from business paperwork to travel arrangement through Glassboard. As far as we’re concerned, email doesn’t exist.</p>
      <p>Externally, Glassboard is how we communicate with our beta team. A lot of the betas I participate in feel like one-sided conversations. We wanted to give our team a way to communicate not just with us, but with each other. We get a lot of great feedback and ideas that way. Brent has used email discussion lists in the past, but Glassboard seems to facilitate more interesting conversations.</p>
      <h4>Why Glassboard? </h4>
      <p>The easy answer is Brent, but that’s not the whole story. We’ve explored other options and have even tried a few out. Glassboard’s web app, iOS app, notifications, and logical hierarchy work for us in a way that nothing else seems to. Email fails because it’s too inclusive of the outside world. For a virtual company like ours, we need a safe space to call our own. </p>
      <h4>If not Glassboard what would you use? </h4>
      <p>I’m just guessing here, but probably something like IRC for chat and email for heavier, asynchronous threads. </p>
